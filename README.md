rotaryenc:

A program to enable rotary encoder support for the Raspberry Pi via GPIO pins on either the Raspberry Pi 
or via the rotary encoder pins on an IQaudioDAC. Originally based on code available at IQaudIO but extended to allow
command line input for generic use.

The volume adjustments can be shaped to compensate or accentuate the logarithmic response of ALSA.

Push button support for rotary encoders that have a push mode will be added to mute/unmute as soon as I can.
Hopefully, packages will be built and supplied to the Tiny Core Linux repository for easier use.

Compilation instructions for all projects are included in the code files.
